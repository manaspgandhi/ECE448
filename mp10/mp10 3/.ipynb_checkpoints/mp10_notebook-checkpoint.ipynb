    "Now, we explain the elements of the loaded model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The states\n",
    "Simillar to the grid world presented in the class, the environment is a grid world with $M \\times N$ cells. $M$ and $N$ are accessible via ```model.M``` and ```model.N```. In the following, cell $(r, c)$ refers to the cell at the $r$-th row and $c$-th column. Each cell represents a state of the MDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The wall\n",
    "The $M \\times N$ boolean matrix ```model.W``` defines the wall in the environment. If ```model.W[r, c] == True```, then the cell $(r, c)$ is occupied by the wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The rewards\n",
    "The $M \\times N$ boolean matrix ```model.TS``` defines the terminal states. ```model.TS[r, c] == True``` if the cell $(r, c)$ is a _terminal state_, and ```TS[r, c] == False``` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $M \\times N$ matrix ```model.R``` defines the rewards. ```model.R[r, c]``` is the reward that the agent can get if it reaches the cell $(r, c)$. For terminal states, the reward will be either $+1$ or $-1$. For non-terminal states, the reward will be a small negative number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, ```model.gamma``` is the discount factor $\\gamma$ you should use when computing the dicounted reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The actions\n",
    "At each non-terminal cell $(r, c)$, there are four available actions for the agent: move __left__, __up__, __right__, or __down__. However, due to environmental disturbances, the agent cannot always move as intended. Instead, an $M \\times N \\times 3$ numpy array is provided to define the movement and can be accessed as ```model.D```. Specifically, the actual movement of the agent will be along the intended direction with probability ```model.D[r, c, 0]```, and will be at the right angles to the intended direction with probability ```model.D[r, c, 1]``` (counter-clockwise) $+$ ```model.D[r, c, 2]``` (clockwise). It is guaranteed that the summation of these three probabilites is one. The next state of the agent will be the next cell along the actual moving direction. However, if the actual movement of the agent results in a collision with the boundary of environment or the wall, the agent will stay in the current cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The fixed transition matrix\n",
    "For the extra credit section, we will use this fixed transition matrix, denoted as `model.FP`. It represents the fixed transition probabilities associated with a given policy. The `model.FP` is an $M \\times N \\times M \\times N$ matrix that specifies the probability of transitioning from any cell $(r, c)$ to any other cell $(r', c')$ given the current policy. The value `model.FP[r, c, r', c']` represents the likelihood of moving from cell $(r, c)$ to cell $(r', c')$  under the fixed policy. This matrix is used to compute the expected utility of each state when the policy is kept constant throughout the evaluation process. Unlike the dynamic policy iteration where the policy might evolve over time, `model.FP` remains unchanged, making it possible to analyze the performance of a specific policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization\n",
    "We also provide a helper function for visualizing the environment, and the utility function. To use it, please run the following. In the figure, \"x\" marks a cell that is occupied by the wall. \"+1\" and \"-1\" mark the terminal states and their rewards."

In this function, you need to consider each state $(r, c)$ and each action $a \\in \\{0\\text{ (left)}, 1\\text{ (up)}, 2\\text{ (right)}, 3\\text{ (down)}\\}$. ```P[r, c, a, r', c']``` should be the probability that the agent will move from cell ```(r, c)``` to ```(r', c')``` if it takes action ```a```. Especially, if ```(r, c)``` is a terminal state, you can simply set ```P[r, c, :, :, :] = 0```, i.e., the probability that the agent move from a terminal state to any state (including itself) is $0$, since once the agent reaches a terminal state, the game is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that the transition matrix ```P``` is very sparse, i.e., most of its elements are zeros. Better data structre such as sparse matrices can be used to improve the efficiency. But in this MP, we simply use a regular numpy array."

Please also keep in mind that cell $(1, 1)$ is occupied by the wall. So, with probability $0.1$ the agent will move up to $(0, 0)$; with probability $0.1$ the agent will move down to $(2, 0)$; with probability $0.8$, it will move as intended (right) but will cause a collision to the wall, and thus the agent will stay at $(1, 0)$ with probability $0.8$."

    "Since we have represented the transition ```P``` and utility ```U_current``` as numpy arrays. The best way to implement this function is to use vectorization. That is, we can rewrite the update rule as some matrix operations and then use numpy's builtin functions to compute them. For example, the summation in the equation is actually an inner product of $P$ and $U_i$. Using numpy's ```dot``` function to compute this inner product is much faster than implementing it as a for loop. However, using vectorization is totally optional for you. The efficiency of your program will not contribute to your score. You will not get any extra credit even if you indeed use vectorization. So feel free to use for loop since it is much easier to implement."

In ```submitted.py```, you can find a predefined variable ```epsilon = 1e-3```. Also, please stop the program after a specifc number of iteration even if it has not converged. 100 iterations should be sufficient for all the tests in this MP."

    "## Extra Credit: Policy Evaluation Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we extend our MDP solver to include policy evaluation, an essential concept from the lectures. Policy evaluation is a process where we compute the utility of following a given policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixed Policy Transition Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume a fixed policy represented by a four-dimensional transition matrix `model.FP[r, c, r', c']`. This matrix provides the probability of transitioning from each state to every other state under the fixed policy. The dimensions correspond to the current state `(r, c)` and the next state `(r', c')`, respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we use value iteration to dynamically choose actions that maximize expected utility, aiming to find the optimal policy. This method continuously updates the policy based on the calculated utilities of states. However, in this section the focus shifts to evaluating the utility of states under a fixed policy, which remains constant throughout the process. This evaluation does not seek to optimize the policy but rather to assess the effectiveness of a given, unchanging strategy.\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Implementation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `policy_evaluation` function iteratively computes the expected utility of each state under the given policy until the utility function converges. The convergence is determined by a small threshold `epsilon`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility of a state under the policy is computed using the following equation as shown in lecture:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_i(s) = r(s) + \\gamma \\sum_{s'} P(s' | s, \\pi_i(s)) u_i(s')\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $u_i(s)$ is the utility of state $s$ at iteration $i$.\n",
    "- $r(s)$ is the immediate reward received when entering state $s$.\n",
    "- $\\gamma$ is the discount factor that balances the importance of immediate and future rewards.\n",
    "- $P(s' | s, \\pi_i(s))$ is the transition probability of moving from state $s$ to state $s'$ under policy $\\pi_i$.\n",
    "- The summation is over all possible next states $s'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "During each iteration, for every state `(r, c)`, we calculate the expected utility as the sum of the utilities of all possible next states `(r', c')`, weighted by the transition probabilities from the current state `(r, c)` to the next state `(r', c')`. We then update the utility of the current state with the immediate reward plus the discounted expected utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the provided policy (encoded in the transition matrix `model.FP` may not necessarily be the optimal policy. It is fixed for the purpose of evaluating how good the policy is in terms of the utility it yields.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may take more than 100 iterations to converge.\n"

It's possible that your code passes all the visible tests, but fails the hidden tests.  If that happens, then it probably means that you hard-coded a number into your function definition, instead of using the input parameter that you were supposed to use.  Debug by running your function with a variety of different input parameters, and see if you can get it to respond correctly in all cases."
